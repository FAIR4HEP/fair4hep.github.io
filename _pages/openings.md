     The experimental high energy physics (HEP) group at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) invites applications 
     from outstanding candidates for the position of postdoctoral researcher to work on the CMS experiment, real-time artificial 
     intelligence (AI), and to apply findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) principles to AI models and data in high energy physics. 
     </p><p>
     The CMS group at UCSD is involved in developing novel geometric deep learning algorithms, including graph neural networks, for event reconstruction, 
     anomaly detection, simulation, and ultrafast applications in field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) for the Level-1 trigger. Our group is also leading 
     searches for exotic long-lived particles and measurements of Lorentz-boosted Higgs boson decays using machine learning (ML). The successful candidate 
     will have the opportunity to join and lead these efforts.
     </p><p>
     As part of the FAIR4HEP project (<a href="https://fair4hep.github.io/">https://fair4hep.github.io/</a>), the successful candidate will also lead the 
     curation of data sources from HEP, development 
     of software frameworks to automatically train, evaluate, and compare benchmark AI models for a variety of HEP tasks, and publish sharable AI models and 
     data following FAIR principles.
     </p><p>
     Ambitious applicants from diverse backgrounds are encouraged to apply.
     </p><p>
     A Ph.D. in physics is required. Prior experience in software development, FPGA firmware design or high-level synthesis, and ML is advantageous, but 
     not essential. Completed applications should be sent to <a href="mailto:duarte-pd-recruit@physics.ucsd.edu">duarte-pd-recruit@physics.ucsd.edu</a> and must include
     </p><p>
     <ul>
     <li>Cover letter (no more than 1 page); </li>
     <li>CV (1-2 pages recommended, but longer accepted);</li>
     <li>Statement of research interests (no more than 2 pages);</li>
     <li>List of publications;</li>
     <li>Three reference letters.</li>
     </ul>
     </p><p>
     The deadline for the receipt of the application is September 8, 2021, but the search will continue until the position is filled.
     </p><p>
     Our research group is committed to creating an antiracist, inclusive, and supportive workspace. UCSD is an equal opportunity/affirmative 
     action employer with a strong institutional commitment to excellence through diversity.

# Open positions

We are always looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit!

You will have the chance to work on the grand challenges of condensed matter physics, often at the interface of instrumental design and new physics. You will be involved in determining the important and interesting questions, creating and improving instrumental setups, performing measurements, and making discoveries.

#### PhD and Postdoc positions
If you are interested in working with us as a PhD student or postdoc, please send me an [email](mailto:milan.allan@gmail.com). State briefly why you are interested and attach a CV, including information about the grades you had as an undergraduate. No need for a separate cover letter or certificates. **Important**: please insert _"Application PhD"_ or _"Application Postdoc"_ in the subject line.

There are some postdoc scholarship available.  I'd be happy to support you after you apply to our group. Take a look at the [veni fellowship](http://www.nwo.nl/en/funding/our-funding-instruments/nwo/innovational-research-incentives-scheme/veni/index.html) or the [Marie Curie fellowship](http://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/about-msca/actions/if/index_en.htm).

#### Leiden University master students
If you are a Master student at Leiden University looking for a Master project, contact me (or any group member) per email or stop by my office.

#### Bsc / Master students from elsewhere
If you are interested in pursuing a Master degree at Leiden University, see [mastersinleiden.nl](http://www.mastersinleiden.nl/programmes/physics/en/introduction). Sometimes, we take master students or summer interns if we get exceptional applicants (this usually means very good grades or a personal recomendation).
